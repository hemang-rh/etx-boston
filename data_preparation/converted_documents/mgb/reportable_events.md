## 7 Reportable Events

## 7.1 Deviations and Noncompliance

Unplanned or unintentional deviations in IRB-approved research may occur during the conduct of a research study or be discovered during routine data monitoring activities of the sponsor or investigator. When an investigator discovers or is made aware of an unapproved deviation, they must report the deviation to the IRB as follows:

- 1. Unapproved major deviations must be reported to the IRB within five (5) working days/seven (7) calendar days of the  date the investigator becomes aware of the unapproved deviation.
- 2. Unapproved minor deviations are to be recorded by the investigator in a protocol-specific Minor  Deviation Log.

Unapproved deviations should be reported to the sponsor as outlined in the sponsor's protocol or  research or investigative plan.

Every deviation needs to be evaluated for whether it negatively affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the participant, the risk: benefit assessment for the participant, and/or the integrity of the data (the ability to draw conclusions from the data, the ability to confirm the validity of the research conduct or the

credibility or accuracy of any reported research results) in order to determine if it's a major or minor deviation.

Deviations that have a significant impact on any of these factors are major. The same type of deviation, depending on its extent and significance, could be major or minor. For example, over-enrolling participants can be minor or major depending on total approved enrollment number, study population, and the total number over-enrolled. An out-of-window study visit can also be minor or major depending on the procedures performed at that study visit and how far it is outside the permitted window. For this reason, each deviation requires a case-by-case assessment of its exact details in order to appropriately categorize it. This should be done by the PI and not delegated to study staff.  Minor deviations must be recorded on the Minor Deviation Log with an appropriate corrective action to address the issue and/or additional steps planned or taken that will prevent the deviation from happening in the future.

Investigators are responsible for monitoring their studies throughout the year for adherence to the IRB approved protocol. The purpose of this monitoring is to identify major deviations and identify trends in minor deviations that may indicate a systemic issue in how the study is being conducted, which could potentially negatively impact participants' rights, safety, or welfare or the integrity of the data. Frequent minor deviations of a similar nature should be reported to the IRB as a major deviation.

Investigators must follow the written protocol as approved by the IRB.  Implementing changes without IRB approval must be reported to the IRB per policy. This applies to deviations from the protocol which are done intentionally or unintentionally, deviations which are identified before they occur but cannot be prevented, and deviations which are discovered after they have occurred. If deviations occur during the conduct of a research study, the investigator must assess whether each deviation is minor or major.

Investigators should assess whether more flexibility can be built into the protocol via amendment to reduce the number of changes that need IRB review, the number of protocol deviations, and non-compliance by investigators.  Areas of flexibility might include broadening eligibility criteria, adding more flexible study visit or sample collection windows, allowing remote or electronic study participation/procedures. Flexibility and optional study procedures should always be evaluated in the context of the study design to ensure that the options can be practically implemented, and that evaluable data will still be collected to address study hypotheses, aims, and outcomes/endpoints.

## 7.2 Exception Requests

Investigators conducting human subject research approved by the Mass General Brigham IRB are required to submit proposed changes in approved research, including single participant or other limited exceptions, for review and approval prior to initiation of the change, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to participants.

## 7.2.1 Changes to Eliminate Apparent Immediate Hazards to Participants

Changes to study conduct to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to participants are permissible without prior IRB approval to protect the safety and welfare of enrolled participants. Investigators must report to the IRB any unapproved changes to study conduct which were made in order to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to participants. Such changes must be reported in an expedited manner using an Other Events submission, subsequent to the change being made.

## 7.2.2 Single Participant or Other Limited Exceptions

For planned exceptions from the protocol, for a single or more participants, a formal protocol amendment must be submitted to obtain IRB approval for the modified study procedure.  Planned exception requests such as non-time sensitive enrollment of a participant who does not meet all eligibility criteria or planned modifications to an upcoming part of the protocol for an enrolled participant must be submitted as protocol amendments.  The IRB will not approve planned or anticipated deviations as exception requests, unless the change is time-sensitive and relevant to only one participant as described below. Planned or anticipated changes to the protocol , for a single or more participants, need to be formalized through an amendment process; if they occur without an amendment, they are incurred protocol deviations and should be recorded/reported in accordance with deviation policies.

If the investigator submits an amendment to propose a protocol change, the investigator should not also submit an exception request to implement the change while the amendment is pending IRB review.  The change cannot be implemented until the amendment has been approved by the IRB.

For unplanned exceptions, or planned exceptions for which there is insufficient time to get an amendment approved (i.e., <X days), the IRB will consider single participant or limited exceptions on a case-by-case basis. These requests must be submitted to the IRB in a prospective manner (i.e., before the change is implemented) as an Other Event submission and cannot be implemented until the IRB has approved the exception request.  If there is any indication or plan that the same or similar exception request will be needed for additional participants in the future, an amendment to the protocol should be submitted. Typically, the IRB will not approve the same type of exception for a second participant.  In most circumstances, such exception requests will be returned to the research team with the requirement to submit an amendment instead.

An exception request will not be approved by the IRB if the protocol change has already occurred without prior IRB approval, even if approval was obtained from another entity (e.g., study sponsor). Such change is then an incurred protocol deviation and should be recorded/reported in accordance with deviation policies.

For studies ceded to an external IRB, amendment and exception requests should be submitted to the IRB providing oversight.

## 7.3 When and How to Report Events to the IRB

## 7.3.1 Guidance for Reporting Events:

Certain events and new information require prompt reporting to the reviewing and/or relying IRBs, sponsors, and/or funding entities.  These events include, but are not limited to, noncompliance, unanticipated problems, major deviations, information that represents new risks, suspensions by other regulatory agencies, and certain types of audit and inspection

outcomes.  This guidance summarizes what types of events require reporting to the IRB or other Research Offices, details on how to submit/report, and associated reporting timeframes.

For guidance on what to include in Other Event submissions (OEs) (events that are reportable to the Mass General Brigham IRB) and Corrective and Preventative Actions (CAPAs), please review the information provided at the end of this document.

## 7.3.2 When Relying on an External Reviewing IRB:

**Important Note: When the Mass General Brigham site is relying on an external (non-Mass General Brigham) IRB for review of the research (i.e., Cede Review), you must report to the external reviewing IRB and follow their reporting requirements. In addition, you must notify the Mass General Brigham IRB within the specified timelines, as indicated in the tables below. Please note that if the study is ceded to an external reviewing IRB, include documentation of the external IRB's determination of the event with your other event submission to the Mass General Brigham IRB. However, do not wait to submit; include as much information as possible and then submit the external reviewing IRB's determination once received.

## 7.3.4 Submitting Other Events and Identifying the Root Cause

## What to submit with your Other Event:

While conducting research, even the most experienced and diligent research teams deviate from the approved protocol or experience unexpected events.  These deviations and unexpected events must be identified, evaluated, and responded to in order to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of participants and others and the integrity of the research data.

When events occur that require prompt reporting (i.e., within 5 business days), it is important to provide to the IRB as much information as is known at the time of initial reporting.  Even if limited or preliminary information is available and you are still collecting information, it is required that the IRB is informed within the specified reporting window, i.e., by submitting an Other Event in Insight.  Inform the IRB if additional information is still pending, but do not wait for it to submit the initial report.

For more information about Identifying the Root Cause and developing a robust Corrective and Preventative Action Plan (CAPA), see the sections below.

In addition to completing the Other Event form in Insight, utilize the worksheet below to help gather information needed for IRB review. A Word version of the worksheet can be downloaded here: Other Event Reporting Worksheet .

## 7.3.5 Other Event Reporting Worksheet

## Other Event Reporting Worksheet

Please note that if the study is ceded to an external reviewing IRB, include documentation of the external IRB's determination of the event with your other event submission to the Mass General Brigham IRB

## Event Description and Root Cause Analysis

Provide a detailed description of the event (If only limited or preliminary information is available, provide as many details about the event as possible at the time of initial reporting.) :

## Corrective and Preventive Actions

## Describe the actions(s) already taken to address the event/problem.

- · Including who was responsible for implementing the corrective actions and
- · a timeline for when the actions occurred.

## Describe the future action(s) that will be taken to address the event/problem. Please describe:

- · what is being done to prevent the event/problem from recurring in the future,
- · including who will be responsible for implementing the corrective actions and
- · a timeline for when the actions will be implemented.

Potential corrective actions could include, but are not limited to:

- · Careful review of all study records, including informed consent, to identify similar issues.
- · Re-education of study staff (must be documented)
- o Re-education could include completion of relevant courses in HealthStream available from the HRA Compliance and Education Office Pages - Education (Human Research) (sharepoint.com)
- o Develop an internal study team monitoring plan to periodically assess compliance with approved protocols, research regulations, institutional policies, and compliance with the corrective actions.

## Have participants been notified, or will they be notified of the event?

- · Why or why not?
- · If notifying, specify which participants, e.g., all active participants, all consented participants, etc., along with justification for this plan.

## When applicable, will participants need to be re-consented considering the event?

- · If they do, please describe the timeline for re-consent.

## Will a study amendment (e.g., revisions to the protocol and/or consent form(s)) be needed to address the event?

- · Note: An amendment may be required for patient-facing documents/notifications, such as emails, letters, phone scripts, etc.
- o Revised Investigator Brochures (IB) should be submitted via Amendment if there are changes being made to the protocol, consent, or other study documents.
- · If yes , include:
- o What is the timeline for the amendment?

- o Whether an amendment has already been submitted to the IRB or when an amendment will be forthcoming (e.g., The sponsor is working on changes to the protocol and informed consent, and an amendment will be submitted once received.

## How will the effectiveness of the corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) be determined?

- · How will effectiveness be determined and defined?
- · Who will be responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of the CAPA, and when will this occur?

## 7.3.6 Immediate Corrective Actions:

If you become aware of a deviation or unexpected event, take immediate corrective actions to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of the participants. This is often done prior to IRB approval because of the immediate action needed.

Immediate corrective actions may be in the form of a phone call, scheduling an unscheduled office visit, ordering a redraw of labs/tests/and/or procedures, etc., to ensure the participant(s) are safe.  Document the deviation, the reason it occurred, and all immediate corrections/actions taken and report to the IRB within the required timeframe(s).

Although it is important to take immediate actions to eliminate harm, you should be sure to report the event to all appropriate parties (sponsor, funding entities, CRO, etc.) and to the Mass General Brigham IRB in accordance with their reporting requirements and timeframes (outlined in the table above).

## 7.3.7 Root Cause Analysis (RCA):

A root cause analysis (RCA) is the process of identifying and documenting the root cause of problems in order to identify appropriate solutions. RCAs should focus on identifying underlying problems that contribute to errors or issues rather than focusing on mistakes made by individuals.

It is important to identify the cause or source of a problem or issue so that it can be resolved to prevent recurrence.  There may be multiple reasons or causes that contribute to a problem.  Conversely, there may be multiple methods to resolve each cause.  The root cause is the initiating, most basic cause of a problem that may or may not lead to a chain of causes or other problems.  Eliminating the root cause should prevent recurrence.

## Steps:

- 1. Identify/define the problem.
- 2. Collect data.
- · Interview those impacted by the problem.
- ·
- Interview those people responsible for the problem, if applicable.
- 3. Identify causal factors.
- · Keep asking 'why' and 'how' until you reach the root cause.
- 4. Determine the root cause.
- 5. Develop corrective and preventative actions.
- 6. Implement actions.
- 7. Evaluate for effectiveness.

## Things to consider:

- · Careful review of all study records, including informed consent, to identify similar issues.
- · Re-education of study staff (must be documented) Re-education could include completion of relevant courses in HealthStream from the HRA Compliance & Education Office
- o Pages - Education (Human Research) (sharepoint.com)
- · Develop an internal study team monitoring plan to periodically assess compliance with approved protocols, research regulations, institutional policies, and compliance with corrective actions.
- · If participants need to be notified of any of the errors or there needs to be re-consented - how do you propose to do that, and specifically for which participants?
- · Any data/specimens that were collected without consent or from ineligible participants - do you plan to retain or sequester these?
- o Are you able to get consent?
- o If not, how do you plan to move forward with them?
- · Are you making changes to the protocol?
- o If so, detail and explain how they should alleviate future errors.
-  You will also need to document when staff will be trained on these changes.
- · What, if any, staffing changes are required, and how will they contribute to preventing the issue in the future?
- · What if any workflow changes are being made in your lab/clinic/research unit, and how will they contribute to preventing the issue in the future (this can include the creation of new tracking forms, new checklists, any 'behind-the-scenes forms' to ensure research procedures are done and documented.
- o It can also include adjusting and identifying what staff are responsible for what actions.
- · What, if any, workflow changes are being made between your lab and departments with whom you collaborate, and how will they contribute to preventing the issue in the future?
- · How will the above individuals - those involved in the identified process changes or new personnel - be educated on these changes?

Please note that in addition to your outlined corrective and preventative actions, the IRB may impose other required actions. See the next section of this guidance for more details about CAPAs.

## 7.3.8 Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) Plans:

Corrective actions are those taken to resolve a problem, and preventive actions are those actions that keep the problem from recurring.

## Corrective actions:

Now that you have assessed the rights, welfare, and safety of the participants and have identified the root cause, you should consider additional reporting to the sponsor and IRB.  As a reminder, you should have already submitted your initial report to the IRB, even if only limited or preliminary information is available. Provide as much detail about the event (as detailed below) as possible at the time of initial reporting.

Ensure that the reports to the sponsor and IRB are accurate and thorough and that the CAPA is included.  Additionally, there may be actions that should be taken to correct the problem, but that were not required to be taken before IRB review as they were not needed to protect the rights, welfare, and safety of participants and others.

## Preventive actions:

Preventive actions are necessary to ensure that the problem does not repeat itself.  Preventive actions should be based on the process.  Create and document a process or standard operating procedure (SOP).  Train on the process, implement the process, evaluate the process, and amend the process as necessary.  Consider revising the protocol or informed consent as applicable.

## CAPAs must be thorough:

Specific: Identify the actions that will be taken to address the root cause, the individual (role) responsible for taking the actions, and where documentation of the actions will be kept.

Timely: Include the date(s) when the actions will be completed.

Measurable: Include a process of assessment of the action plan's effectiveness and a process by which the plan will be amended if it is found to be ineffective.

## CAPAs must be well documented in the research records!

## 7.3.10 Example CAPA:

## Description of the Event(s)/Deviation(s):

Four of the five newly hired research coordinators implemented and participated in human subjects research prior to being added and approved by the IRB, prior to completing Mass General Brigham-required human subjects training and prior to receiving protocol-specific training. This was identified during a review by the Compliance and Education Office and is detailed in the attached report.

The Research Manager reviewed the study history and IRB-approved personnel log with the study team history and confirmed that there have only been four occurrences where an unapproved member of the study team participated in research. This was not identified in other studies and specifically occurred in the above-mentioned study.

## Root Cause:

There was not a process to ensure that new hires to the research team had all required actions and education taken before participating in Human Subject Research.

## Corrective Actions:

The research manager created an SOP for new hire onboarding and a supporting checklist; see attached. The research manager reviewed the SOP with the research staff and PI.   This review is documented in a note-to-file, see attached, and

will be kept in the regulatory record. The four research team members completed the Mass General Brigham human subjects training requirements (GCP and Clinical Research Boot Camp), see attached, and a modification to add them to the IRB application and protocol has been submitted to the IRB.  The research team members were also trained by the research manager and PI on the above research protocol; see attached.  Documentation of their training is filed in the regulatory binder.

## Preventive Actions:

The new hire SOP checklist will be utilized by the research manager and the principal investigator to ensure that new hires are appropriately on-boarded before participating in the research.  The final step of the onboarding process is the sign-off on the checklist by both the research manager and the principal investigator.

A note-to-file was created by the research manager indicating the start date of the new SOP and checklist; see attached.  The completed checklists will be kept in the regulatory record with the delegation of authority log.

The research manager and the principal investigator will review the implementation of the new SOP and checklist after each of the next three new hires and will document the review in a note to file to be kept in the regulatory record.  If the result of the reviews is that the SOP and checklist are working as expected, a note to file will be placed in the regulatory record indicating the plan as effective, with an effectiveness check moving to an annual review.

If the SOP and/or checklist require revision, those revisions will be documented in a note to file kept in the regulatory record and the process for evaluating the next three new hires will start again.
