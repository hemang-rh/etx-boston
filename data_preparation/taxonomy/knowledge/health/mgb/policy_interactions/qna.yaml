  - context: |
      Mass General Brigham (MGB) and its Affiliated Institutions have a longstanding history of fostering collaborations
      with Industry and other Outside Entities. These collaborations are pivotal in advancing MGB's mission to deliver
      leading-edge patient care, research, and medical education. While such relationships are encouraged, MGB
      acknowledges the potential for conflicts of interest or commitment, which might compromise integrity, independence,
      professional judgment, or MGB's reputation. However, these risks are often manageable, enabling relationships to
      proceed due to their importance to MGB's goals. MGB has established a Policy for Interactions with Industry and
      Other Outside Entities to ensure these relationships are reviewed and managed consistently with MGB’s values.

  - context: |
      Disclosure of financial interests is an important aspect of human subjects research to ensure transparency and trust.
      Institutions and researchers must disclose all material financial interests related to the study to the participants.
      These disclosures are guided by the Public Health Service regulations and are overseen by the Committee on Oversight
      of Activities (COA). The Institutional Review Board (IRB) determines the precise wording of the disclosure in the
      consent form. The consent form must explain that the financial interest has been reviewed and approved by the IRB.
      Additionally, participants must be informed that they can access further details about the financial interest and how
      it is being managed.
