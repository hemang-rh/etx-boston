  - context: |
      Mass General Brigham (MGB) and its Affiliated Institutions have a longstanding history of fostering collaborations 
      with Industry and other Outside Entities. These collaborations are pivotal in advancing MGB's mission to deliver 
      leading-edge patient care, research, and medical education. While such relationships are encouraged, MGB 
      acknowledges the potential for conflicts of interest or commitment, which might compromise integrity, independence, 
      professional judgment, or MGB's reputation. However, these risks are often manageable, enabling relationships to 
      proceed due to their importance to MGB's goals. MGB has established a Policy for Interactions with Industry and 
      Other Outside Entities to ensure these relationships are reviewed and managed consistently with MGB’s values.
