      Unplanned or unintentional deviations in IRB-approved research may occur during the conduct of a research study or be
      discovered during routine data monitoring activities of the sponsor or investigator. When an investigator discovers or is
      made aware of an unapproved deviation, they must report the deviation to the IRB as follows:
      1. Unapproved major deviations must be reported to the IRB within five (5) working days/seven (7) calendar days of the date the investigator becomes aware of the unapproved deviation.
      2. Unapproved minor deviations are to be recorded by the investigator in a protocol-specific Minor Deviation Log.
      Unapproved deviations should be reported to the sponsor as outlined in the sponsor’s protocol or research or
      investigative plan.
      Every deviation needs to be evaluated for whether it negatively affected the rights, safety, or welfare of the
      participant, the risk: benefit assessment for the participant, and/or the integrity of the data
      (the ability to draw conclusions from the data, the ability to confirm the validity of the research conduct or the
      credibility or accuracy of any reported research results) in order to determine if it’s a major or minor deviation.
      Deviations that have a significant impact on any of these factors are major. The same type of deviation, depending
      on its extent and significance, could be major or minor. For example, over-enrolling participants can be minor or
      major depending on total approved enrollment number, study population, and the total number over-enrolled. An
      out-of-window study visit can also be minor or major depending on the procedures performed at that study visit
      and how far it is outside the permitted window. For this reason, each deviation requires a case-by-case assessment
      of its exact details in order to appropriately categorize it. This should be done by the PI and not delegated to study
      staff. Minor deviations must be recorded on the Minor Deviation Log with an appropriate corrective action to
      address the issue and/or additional steps planned or taken that will prevent the deviation from happening in the
      future.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What do I do if I discover a violation in the IRB-approved policy?
        answer: |
          1. Unapproved major deviations must be reported to the IRB within five (5) working days/seven (7) calendar days of the date the investigator becomes aware of the unapproved deviation.
          2. Unapproved minor deviations are to be recorded by the investigator in a protocol-specific Minor Deviation Log.
      - question: |
          Does the severity of a violation matter?
        answer: |
          Yes, the type of deviation, extent, and significance all matter in determining whether a violation is major or minor.
      - question: |
          Does the severity of a violation matter?
        answer: |
          Yes, the type of deviation, extent, and significance all matter in determining whether a violation is major or minor.
  - context: |
      Investigators are responsible for monitoring their studies throughout the year for adherence to the IRB approved
      protocol. The purpose of this monitoring is to identify major deviations and identify trends in minor deviations
      that may indicate a systemic issue in how the study is being conducted, which could potentially negatively impact
      participants’ rights, safety, or welfare or the integrity of the data. Frequent minor deviations of a similar nature
      should be reported to the IRB as a major deviation.
      Investigators must follow the written protocol as approved by the IRB. Implementing changes without IRB
      approval must be reported to the IRB per policy. This applies to deviations from the protocol which are done
      intentionally or unintentionally, deviations which are identified before they occur but cannot be prevented, and
      deviations which are discovered after they have occurred. If deviations occur during the conduct of a research
      study, the investigator must assess whether each deviation is minor or major.
      Investigators should assess whether more flexibility can be built into the protocol via amendment to reduce the
      number of changes that need IRB review, the number of protocol deviations, and non-compliance by
      investigators. Areas of flexibility might include broadening eligibility criteria, adding more flexible study visit or
      sample collection windows, allowing remote or electronic study participation/procedures. Flexibility and optional
      study procedures should always be evaluated in the context of the study design to ensure that the options can be
      practically implemented, and that evaluable data will still be collected to address study hypotheses, aims, and
      outcomes/endpoints.

      - question: |
          Is it ok for me to miss or skip sections of the written protocol?
        answer: |
          No, you must follow the written protocol as approved by the IRB. Implementing changes without IRB approval must be reported to the IRB per policy. This applies to deviations from the protocol which are done intentionally or unintentionally, deviations which are identified before they occur but cannot be prevented, and deviations which are discovered after they have occurred.
      - question: |
          I don't know the exact requirements for my project. Is it ok to build some flexibility into the written protocol?
        answer: |
          Yes, you can add amendments to the protocol to build in some additional flexibility. Areas of flexibility might include broadening eligibility criteria, adding more flexible study visit or sample collection windows, allowing remote or electronic study participation/procedures.

      7.3.4 Submitting Other Events and Identifying the Root Cause
      What to submit with your Other Event:
      While conducting research, even the most experienced and diligent research teams deviate from the approved protocol or
      experience unexpected events. These deviations and unexpected events must be identified, evaluated, and responded to
      in order to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of participants and others and the integrity of the research data.
      When events occur that require prompt reporting (i.e., within 5 business days), it is important to provide to the IRB as
      much information as is known at the time of initial reporting. Even if limited or preliminary information is available and
      you are still collecting information, it is required that the IRB is informed within the specified reporting window, i.e., by
      submitting an Other Event in Insight. Inform the IRB if additional information is still pending, but do not wait for it to
      submit the initial report.
      For more information about Identifying the Root Cause and developing a robust Corrective and Preventative Action Plan
      (CAPA), see the sections below.
      In addition to completing the Other Event form in Insight, utilize the worksheet below to help gather information needed
      for IRB review. A Word version of the worksheet can be downloaded here: Other Event Reporting Worksheet.

        answer: |
          You must submit your report within the timeframe. Even if information is preliminary or additional information is still pending, do not wait for it to submit the initial report.
      - question: |
          Is it ok for there to be deviations?
        answer: |
          Yes, it is ok for there to be deviations. While conducting research, even the most experienced and diligent research teams deviate from the approved protocol or experience unexpected events.
      - question: |
          Remind me why we have to follow all these Institutional Review Board procedures?
        answer: |
          Deviations and unexpected events must be identified, evaluated, and responded to in order to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of participants and others and the integrity of the research data.

      A root cause analysis (RCA) is the process of identifying and documenting the root cause of problems in order to identify
      appropriate solutions. RCAs should focus on identifying underlying problems that contribute to errors or issues rather
      than focusing on mistakes made by individuals.
      It is important to identify the cause or source of a problem or issue so that it can be
      resolved to prevent recurrence. There may be multiple reasons or causes that
      contribute to a problem. Conversely, there may be multiple methods to resolve
      each cause. The root cause is the initiating, most basic cause of a problem that
      may or may not lead to a chain of causes or other problems. Eliminating the root
      cause should prevent recurrence.
      Steps:
      1. Identify/define the problem.
      2. Collect data.
      • Interview those impacted by the problem.
      • Interview those people responsible for the problem, if applicable.
      3. Identify causal factors.
      • Keep asking “why” and “how” until you reach the root cause.
      4. Determine the root cause.
      5. Develop corrective and preventative actions.
      6. Implement actions.
      7. Evaluate for effectiveness.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question:
          Why do we need to identify a root cause to the problem?
        answer:
          It is important to identify the cause or source of a problem or issue so that it can be resolved to prevent recurrence.
      - question:
          What are the steps in a root cause analysis?
        answer:
          Identify/define the problem, collect data, identify causal factors, determine the root cause, develop corrective and preventative actions, implement actions, and evaluate for effectiveness.
      - question:
          Will there always be just one root cause?
        answer:
          No, there may be multiple reasons or causes that contribute to a problem.
